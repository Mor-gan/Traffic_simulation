                                TRAFFIC MODEL
 
 About project:
 
- This projects analyses a taffic model system for motorcycles. There are three different files which implemented three possible traffic systems models. 
 
Tools:

- The visualization code is done on Jupiter lab
- The main implementation code is built on VScode.
 
 The implementations(VScode):
 
 - The "car_simulation" file serves as the main module.
 - The "density_speed" file updates the simulation model in respect to the density of vehicles and how it affects the speed.
 - The "vehicle_types" file investigate the average speed of different automobiles (Cars and Buses).
 
 How to run the program: 
 - For VScode, install numpy in the python environment using "pip install numpy" from the terminal as well as the matplot package.
 - For Jupiter lab code, import numPy function as np and import the matplot pacakege for plot visualization.
 - Run the python code (.py files) to print the result of the values in the terminal.
